    <h1>Luxury cars</h1>
    <p> A luxury car is a car that provides above-average to high-end levels of comfort, features, equipment, and or performance. Often more expensive materials and surface finishes are used, and buyers expect better build quality. The usually higher pricing and more upscale appearance is often associated with higher social status of the users, compared to low and mid market segment cars.

        The term is relative and partially subjective, reflecting both objective qualities of a car, as well as the projected and perceived image of the car marque.[1] Luxury brands rank above premium brands, though there is no clear demarcation between the two.[2] </p>
