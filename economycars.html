    <h1>Economy Cars</h1>
    <p>
        Economy car is a term mostly used in the United States for cars designed for low-cost purchase and operation. Typical economy cars are small (compact or subcompact), lightweight, and inexpensive to both produce and purchase. Stringent design constraints generally force economy car manufacturers to be inventive.[1] Many innovations in automobile design were originally developed for economy cars, such as the Ford Model and the Austin Mini.
